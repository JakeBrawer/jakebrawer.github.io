**Co-first authors:** Meiying Qin and Jake Brawer contributed equally to this work.
 This paper presents **TRI-STAR**, a framework for teaching robots tool-use skills that generalize across tasks, tools, and robot platforms. With only 20 demonstrations, TRI-STAR learns adaptable and transferable tool-use strategies, enabling robots to solve diverse tasks using novel tools.
