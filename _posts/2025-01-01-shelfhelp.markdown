ShelfAware is a modular localization system for carts, wearable devices, or robots that operates in cluttered, symmetric environments like grocery stores. Using only RGB-D and visual odometry cameras, it fuses semantic classification and depth into a novel particle filter framework for robust pose estimation without relying on LiDAR or wheel odometry.
