This paper investigates how epigenetic operators, alongside standard genetic operators like recombination and mutation, shape the evolution of physically embodied robots. Results show that epigenetic operators can lead to qualitatively different evolutionary outcomes, with some effects reducing adaptability compared to traditional genetic processes.
