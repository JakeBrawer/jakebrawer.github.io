This paper introduces a taxonomy of robot-to-human handovers and focuses on **task-oriented handovers**, where the object is passed in a way that facilitates immediate tool use. The proposed method trains the robot via tool-use demonstrations, enabling adaptable handovers even for novel tools and unusual usage contexts.
